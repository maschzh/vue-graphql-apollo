# Vue Apollo GraphQl

## Development
Run the following command in root folder. This will start up both the node backend AND the vue frontend which is located in /client
```
npm run dev
```

Use caution with npm and the folders. There are two package.json files. One for backend (root folder) and one for Vue frontend (client folder)
